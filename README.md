### Bonjour Hi!

🇲🇶🇲🇶 Currently a graduate student at McGill University 🇲🇶🇲🇶

Former jack of all trades, master of none. That's just a way of describing my previous lives. I've:
- 📚 been a university librarian at [Drexel](https://drexel.edu)
- 🔌 worked on power relay devices used in deep oil fields at [SEL,Inc](https://selinc.com)
- 📈 spent a year on the trading floor working with electricity options trading at [SIG](https://sig.com)
- 🚚 helped set up the product analytics stack for a [pre-seed startup](https://ziki.kitchen) that brought food trucks onto the online marketplace
- 🏥 built parsers for electronic medical records in an attempt to mitigate wasted debt at [OODA Health](https://www.cedar.com/all-press/cedar-announces-agreement-to-acquire-ooda-health-to-revolutionize-the-consumer-financial-experience-in-healthcare-2/)
- 🏥 overseen data products handling medical bills for millions of Americans at [Cedar](https://www.cedar.com)
- 🥦 been the primary technical liaison for a product team at [Amazon Fresh](https://www.amazon.com/fmc/storefront?almBrandId=QW1hem9uIEZyZXNo) and [Whole Foods Market](https://www.wholefoodsmarket.com)
- 🇺🇸 lived in Philly, New York and Chicago

I'm currently taking my time to spend more time writing code and shipping things I love or find interesting.
