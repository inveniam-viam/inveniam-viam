### Bonjour Hi!

🇲🇶 Currently a graduate student at McGill University 

Former jack of all trades, master of none. That's just a way of describing my previous lives. I've:
- 📚 been a university librarian at Drexel
- 🔌 worked on power relay research and development at SEL,Inc
- 📈 spent a year on the trading floor working with electricity options trading at SIG
- 🚚 helped set up the product analytics stack for a pre-seed startup that brought food trucks onto the online marketplace
- 🏥 built parsers for electronic medical records in an attempt to mitigate wasted debt at OODA Health
- 🏥 overseen data products handling medical bills for millions of Americans at Cedar
- 🥦 been the primary technical liaison for a product team at Amazon Fresh and Whole Foods Market
- 🇺🇸 lived in Philly, New York and Chicago

I'm currently taking my time to spend more time on computer science fundamentals and shipping things I love or find interesting.
